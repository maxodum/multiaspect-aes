It’s like, what if you get sick or you have a lot of homework? You can’t even take a break. You have to study all the time. It’s not fair. I mean, some people might say it’s a good way to save time, but I think it’s not. It’s way too much pressure. You have to take all the classes in three years, and you don’t have time to relax. You can’t even go to the movies or hang out with your friends. You have to be at school all the time. It’s not like you can just take a vacation or something. \n",

      "When you work with a group or alone, it is important to know which one is the best. Some people think that working with a group is the best way because you can share your ideas with others. But other people think that working alone is better because you can do the work by your self. I think that working alone is better because you can work faster and you do not have to worry about other people. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you work with a group, you have to listen to others and sometimes you have to wait for your turn. This can be very annoying because you might not get to do the work you want to do. Also, if someone in the group is not working hard, it can make the whole group slow down. For example, if you are working on a project and one person is not doing their part, the whole project can be late. That is why I prefer to work alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Working alone also helps you to be more focused. When you are alone, you can concentrate on your work without distractions. You don’t have to worry about what others are doing or if they are helping. You can just do your best. For instance, when I study for a test, I like to do it by myself. It helps me to remember things better. \n",
      "\n",
      "But some people say that working in a group is fun because you can talk and laugh with others. They say that it is easier to get ideas from your friends. But I don’t think that is true. Sometimes, when people are in a group, they argue about what to do. They might not agree on the best way to do something. That can cause problems. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, working with a group can be hard if you don’t get along with the other people. If you are not friendly, it can be hard to work together. You might feel lonely or frustrated. That is why I think it is better to work alone. \n",

But some people say that working alone is better because you can do your work faster and you don’t have to worry about other people. I think that working with a group is better because when you work with a group you can talk to other people and they can give you advice. Also, if you work with a group you can do more work because there are more people. But working alone is also good because you can do your work without any distractions. But I think that working with a group is better because you can learn from other people. For example, when I was in school, I worked with a group on a project and we all helped each other. We had different ideas and we all contributed. But sometimes when we worked with a group, we had problems because some people didn’t do their part. So working with a group can be good or bad. On the other hand, working alone is good because you can focus on your work. But if you work alone, you might get bored or you might not have anyone to talk to. I think that working with a group is better because you can learn from others and you can have fun. But if you work alone, you can do your work faster. So, working with a group is better than working alone. But I also think that working alone is good in some situations. So, it depends on the person and the situation.

Because when you work with a group, you have more people to help you. Like, if you have a problem, you can ask someone else in the group. But sometimes, working alone is also good. For example, if you are doing a project that needs a lot of thinking, you can do it by yourself. But then again, if you work with a group, you can share ideas. So, it depends on what you are doing. \n",

      "Like, if you are doing a big project, like building a model, you need a group. Because building a model takes a lot of time, and if you work alone, you might not finish it. But if you work with a group, you can split the work. For example, one person can do the research, one can do the design, and another can do the actual building. That way, everyone helps and it goes faster. But sometimes, working alone is better. Like, if you are writing an essay, you can think by yourself and not have to argue with others. \n",

I like to eat meat because it is tasty and it make you strong. But some people don't like meat because they think it is not healthy. I think meat is healthy because my dad eat meat and he is very strong. Also, I like to eat pizza for lunch. Pizza is my favorite food. It is hot and it is full of cheese and tomato. I eat pizza every day for lunch. \n",

I like to drink juice and water. Sometimes I bring my own juice from home. \n",

      "I think lunch menus are very important because you need to eat something good to be healthy. If you eat bad food, you will feel sick. But if you eat good food, you will feel happy and strong.

Some people say that character is like a big tree. When you plant a seed, it grows into a big tree. But if the seed is bad, then the tree will be bad. So, the character of a person is like the seed. If you have a good character, then you will have a good life. If you have a bad character, then you will have a bad life. People should always try to have a good character. Because if you have a good character, then others will like you. And if you have a bad character, then others will not like you.\\n\\nBut what is character? Character is like a person\\u2019s inside. It is the way a person acts and thinks. For example, if a person is kind, then he has a good character. If a person is mean, then he has a bad character. Some people think that character is not important. They say that money is more important. But I think that character is more important than money. Because money can be lost, but character can\\u2019t be lost. If you have a good character, then you can always be happy. Even if you lose your money, you can still be happy because you have a good character.\\n\\nSome people say that character is not something you can change. But I think that character can be changed. If you want to change your character, you have to work hard. For example, if you are lazy, you can become more hard-working. If you are rude, you can become more polite. But it is not easy. It takes a lot of time and effort. But if you want to be a good person, you have to change your character.\\n\\nAnother example is my friend. My friend used to be very rude. He always talked to people in a bad way. But then he started to change. He started to be kind and polite. Now he\",\n          \">\\n\\n**First Impressions**\\n\\nFirst impression is very important because it is the first thing that people see when they meet you. So, if you have a bad first impression, people might not like you. But if you have a good first impression, people might like you more. But sometimes, people can be wrong about their first impression. Like, if someone is really nice, but they look angry, people might think they are mean. But actually, they are not. So, first impression is not always correct. But it is important to make a good first impression because people judge you based on that.\\n\\nWhen you meet someone, you need to be polite and friendly. If you are not polite, people might think you are rude. Also, you need to dress properly. If you are wearing clothes that are too casual, people might think you are not serious. But sometimes, people can be too strict about first impressions. Like, if you are wearing a t-shirt and jeans, some people might think you are not professional. But if you are going to a casual place, then it is okay.\\n\\nAnother thing that affects first impressions is your body language. If you are smiling and making eye contact, people might think you are friendly. But if you are not smiling and looking away, people might think you are not interested. So, body language is important. But sometimes, people can misinterpret body language. Like, if you are crossing your arms, people might think you are angry, but you might just be cold.\\n\\nAlso, the way you speak can affect your first impression. If you talk too fast or too slow, people might not understand you. But if you speak clearly and politely, people might think you are smart. But sometimes, people can be too harsh on others. Like, if someone is trying to talk, but they are not speaking well, people might not give them a chance. But that is not fair.\\n\\nSo, first impressions are important,\",\n          \">\\n\\n**Summer Projects**\\n\\nSummer project is a very important thing for student to do.
