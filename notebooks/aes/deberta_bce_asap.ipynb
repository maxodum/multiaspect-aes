They don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. You also @MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise.Well you are right but I am going to explain way your wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. Some of thoes websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example, you could learn their culture and the @CAPS5 they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you could do so the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends. Well you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can webcam people. When you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam. Lastly you could go into chatrooms like @CAPS7 ( aol instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com car give you a might eating schedual right for your . After that website you could go out and get the you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand-eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen your had is controling the \\\" mouse\\\" while the, mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world. So now hopefully you agree with me that computers do acctually benift some things in life. I have showed you what you can learn about, talk to people and socialize and lastly help you with your health. \",\n          \"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that computers effect people? I think I @CAPS1 agree that computers affect people. I @CAPS1 agree with this statement because people dont get use to doing other things then stay on the computer. One example is that people that @CAPS1 stay on the computer wont have much fun on other people. They wont enjoy as much by stay on the internet. My last example is that doctors sometimes say its not good for you to stay on the the computer. First of all, people that stay on the computer wont have much fun on othe poeple. I know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time. One idea in that there not alot to do on a computer for some people. People dont go out and have fun like going to the mall with your friends. Some people try to focused on the computer if theres something importent they have to do. Thirldy, people wont enjoy themselves. When @CAPS2 on the computer I really dont enjoy myself by just sitting there on the internet. One important fact is that you wont want to enjoy a beautiful day with your family when ther going to the beach. People will take maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep and you wont have nothing else to do for the rest of the day. Sometime you wont have a good life without enjoying it. Lastly, doctors say its not good for you to always stay on the computer. One important fact is that you always need to excersise instead of lamping around. Sometimes might happen to your eyes because your steading looking at the computer. You need to do healthy things to help your body. In conclusion, I had agree on the statement and my reasons why was because you wont have fun. You wont enjoy yourself, and doctors. Say its not good for you I hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper.\",\n          \"School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said \\\"you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic.\\\" @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_df = pd.concat([train_df, pseudo_df], ignore_index=True)"],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T15:36:53.692866Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T15:36:53.693453Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T15:36:53.700355Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T15:36:53.69343Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T15:36:53.699787Z"},"id":"o5N06qKhmrla"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":790},"id":"ISc9p0ha2HcP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746119723000,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":367,"user":{"displayName":"Максим Думенков","userId":"09797172204664177173"}},"outputId":"3df25aba-c5a9-4ecc-e898-a475481bbc7a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                              full_text  Overall  Cohesion  \\\n","0     The American jazz legend Duke Ellington said \"...      4.5       4.5   \n","1     Students will struggle to learn the subjects t...      3.5       3.0   \n","2     One of John Lubbock famous quotes is, \" Your c...      3.0       4.0   \n","3     My mom always tell me \" keep going until you r...      4.0       4.0   \n","4     Technology allows people to complete many task...      4.0       4.5   \n","...                                                 ...      ...       ...   \n","7466  The author is writting about taking books off ...

Also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process. The last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it. The first reason I believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they arn't getting any exercise. This problem with children getting fat is already a very brought up topic and with something like this out it's not going to get any better any time soon. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kids who are on the computer more than a hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. This means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids that our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. The last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight. This can also bad for future generations. If you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect. These are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society. kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eye sight from it.\",\n          \"what is self- reliance? gladly you ask let me tell you that self reliance is when students and adults make decisions on them self or others. There a lot that we can talk about but i highly recommend start off with the events and problems that we are having today. These events are not only effecting us it's effecting the whole UNITED STATE OF AMERICAN. Government shutdown it not only effect us it's effecting everyone business ,stores,farms . Seeking help and guidance make a huge different .Not only one mind that is speaking but there should be more so we talk and decade bout the issue and we can give more ideas and information. we don't need to tell our child to be followers there are leaders by teaching them these skills make a big impact . Leaders always seek help too they start off small but over the time the income until one point you have all knowledge you need but still to this day we still ask question grab more information.\\n\\nwe can compare these skills and source to our family,jobs,lifestyles.\\n\\nIt's not only students that need it .Having self-reliance and seeking guidance by seeking more information make us better in our jobs,lifestyles. We are also leaning but at the same time we also teaching it to others these skills are not useful. We would all need them reliance can be compare to leaderships standing up with you think it right for you and your career we believe that our answer is right but we don't want to be wrong but by seeking guidance and other people ideas always asking questions give you other option to choose from. I highly recommend that we always want to be the right but sometimes seeking answers and ideas give you more to think bout not only you and others too. we don't have to go far the military ,world decision does it effect us? yes it does why i'm asking you it because things no one really care bout really we should these are problems that need to be solves.\\n\\nMilitary is a job,life and a career in your hands. Those man and woman that are serving our country they had a hard call to make. Before doing all that they need those soldiers to be ready there mind and skills are the most important that were self -reliance comes in to play. They can wait commander give you the call but you have man and woman life on the line you have to make a decisions. That why drill soldiers get you ready at base boot camp for mind and skills to ready and thing of these issue would not happening .doing that time you always need to ask question grab information it important you give you more feedback on what you work with or what are to get these skills are so important not only for the military in our life too we have big decisions to make it can involve your kids or career these thing you need to keep a look out.\\n\\nNO matter what age,race,sex,color you are is so important to seeking these things the are really useful in the future and now always think that these skills get far and one day you would teach you kids bout money and business and more but right we all need to see what is really going with our government make a change we do not what to have a stock market crash again so use your voice,skills and etc to helps others not only yourself this world need to voices and our government need to rise again where it was before our jobs and homes are so important and how we spend our money and time and seeking out questions and answers make a big different in our society and community\\n\\nOur jobs we get by our boss and our boss get there money from the government. When our government shut down there would we lose a lot of money a lot of business owners we lose there business and homes these thing we have to look at not should i get the new 2019 car no what is important is that show other step by step always seek guidance and give new ideas never forget to ask question it doesn't hurt to ask people you would see thing different and clearly. never be fare of asking we here to Lean everyday. we are people and no one is perfect we would learn everyday until we get old never stop seeking answers and always share your ideas to everyone. i'm ending this today saying seek guidance never stop asking question thank you so much for your amazing time have a great day.\",\n          \"Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
