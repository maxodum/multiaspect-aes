Thy agrue that if you work less time , you ll has moer itme into spend by your family , relax , or evening do fun thigns . I do n't think this is a good idea in all . I guess if you wrk four dyas you wo n't has eonugh money for food , pparel and rent . You has to work mroe hours durng tese four dasy , will brand you exhaust . Additionally , some say a four-day ork week is bettr for a environment ecause there is less commutation time . But I do n't that 's ture . If you wokr a four-day job , you may need to trael more becasue you will eed commue more frequently . For example , if you work our days a week , you migth need to commute fur dasy , but if you wok five dyas , you can commute five das . So it 's not truly good for a environment . disadvantgae of a four-day work week is that it can ause a company of lose money . If you work efwer dasy , you won \\u2019 t brand enough moeny If a company  n't brnd thta much money , it may has in lay off employee or not hier new one . This is godo for workre . besides , I do n't thik woring foru ays a week is godo for your health . If you four days , you may has to work more hours each day . For example , if you normally work hours a day , you might need in wokr 10 hours a day for four back-in-back days . The work is hard , and you mgiht get sick . I think a four-day work week is a bad idea . It brand pople work difficult , rand company lose money , and is not good for a nevironment . The nly benefit is more dyas off , but that 's not enouh in make up for it .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

How this can benefits the students?, and lets see if should be good or should not be good.\\n\\nThink about students take their classes from their home, and schools disappears. technology change things and now the schools are online. What is the advantages of students. Some say online schools should be good because they don't have to worry about be on time to get the bus. Although, some people say online schools should not be good because they don't going to know how world works, and they can just play games or distract their self with other things on the computer.\\n\\nit will be good have a school in my house, may be i don't have to wake up early. I don't have to wake up my parents to tell them if they can droop me at school. It will be happier for may students. study in their house with computers, and also they don't have to eat the food of the school. At this day technology is a important tool that we can use for many things, and also adults who don't finish high school can use online school to graduate.\\n\\nIf you think careful online school will have a disadvantages, and students can mess up everything. Some of then will go to study do their home works, but what about others the lazy students. They just going to play games or easily don't enter to the online class.\\n\\nThey will not have some that can push them up. Parents are working, and there is not teacher they going to say \\\"i don't gonna do anything\\\" another fact the online schools is not is they don't practice the responsibility. if they are always in home they will not know how this country (USA) work. Study in home will be fun, but i think is more fun being with your friends out studying together, chill together and do stuff that every teenager do.\\n\\nIts good to have online classes, and also is good go to the school. At this time you can do both. Like everything online schools have good thing and bad thing as a regular school. If the students know have use even regular schools, or online schools they will graduate.\",\n          \"\\\"I want to be a singer!\\\", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. I wouldn't want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. With that being said it would be a huge honor if I you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me.\\n\\nWhile many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success.\\n\\nIn fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in.\\n\\nThe dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldn't be a problem at all. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. Your help wouldn't go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them.\\n\\nOnce the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work I have put in and also being sure with what career I want in my future, I would gain more passion and inspiration. This would help me to push until I have accomplished everything I have worked for. I couldn't of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. With the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, I may become one the greatest artist in this generation.\\n\\nI am hoping you really consider the motivation I have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world.\\n\\nWith that being said, It would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in my career with your help. By leading me in the right path, and by not doing something I am not sure about and letting that go to waste. I would be able to develop the skills you guide me in and also by keeping me on track. The road this company would lead me in would help me become successful. May you please give me the opportunity to suceed? I would love to have your help by keeping me on track to my future.               \",\n          \"Some people say that first impressions are easy to change.
