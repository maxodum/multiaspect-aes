= \"\"\"You are given the following essay. Please provide feedback on the following aspects: Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions, explicitly noting possible improvements where applicable.\n","\n","The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\n","\n","First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you're doing. Because you're defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life and you do what you think is right.\n","\n","Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says \"Those who know God should love others, because God is love.\"\n","\n","Not being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends.\n","\n","Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says \" Honor your father and mother.\"\n","\n","If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing.\n","\n","Some may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays it's really hard to become yourself.\n","\n","In conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. \"\"\"\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KjXMZot5EyZM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745861273425,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Максим Думенков","userId":"09797172204664177173"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_mid = \"\"\"You are given the following essay.

A\n","\n","problem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.\n","\n","First of all it can make you see different then the others. For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but i remember that i was really shy but i think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that i never see in my life but i just need to see it from a different way and dont let nothing happened and ruing the change that i want to make because of just a problem. For example i think that nothing was going to change me and that i dont need to be shy anymore became i need to start seeing everything in a different ways because you can get mad at every one but you need to know what is going to happened after,\n","\n","people may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and don't let nothing or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and can't do nothing about it because is your choice and your problems and you can decide what to do with it.\n","\n","second of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems but she have faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and i'm not scare of high i did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time i see my mom in a airplane it make me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but i see it from a different way and i like the high but also she have to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can no be the same as you.

The user has already given a detailed analysis, but I should go through it step by step as if I'm just starting to evaluate it. Let's break it down based on the aspects mentioned: Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions.\n","\n","Starting with the Overall impression. The essay is about the importance of being oneself, which is a positive and relevant topic. The structure is clear with three main points: making own choices, happiness, and respecting others. Each point is developed, but maybe the conclusion feels a bit repetitive. It's good that the writer uses personal experiences and Bible quotes, which add depth. However, some parts are a bit wordy and could be more concise.\n","\n","Moving on to Cohesion. The essay has a good flow, with each paragraph connecting to the main theme. However, some sentences are a bit run-on, which makes it harder to follow. The transitions between ideas are okay but could be smoother. For example, when the writer talks about personal experience, it's abrupt. Maybe adding a transition like \"For instance\" would help.\n","\n","Looking at Syntax, the sentences vary in length, which is good, but there are some long and complex sentences that might confuse readers. Breaking them into shorter sentences could improve clarity. Also, some sentences start with \"And\" or \"But,\" which is grammatically correct but can make the writing feel a bit informal.\n","\n","Vocabulary-wise, the essay uses a good range of words, but some could be more precise. For example, \"amazing\" is a strong word; maybe \"impressive\" or \"outstanding\" would work better. There's a tendency to repeat words like \"happy\" and \"respect,\" which could be varied to enhance the writing.\n","\n","Phraseology is mostly clear, but some phrases are awkward. For example, \"the world that constantly trying to make you something else\" should be \"constantly tries\" or \"is constantly trying.\" Also, some passive constructions could be active for stronger impact.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions have some issues. There are run-on sentences, missing commas, and subject-verb agreement errors. For example, \"you make your own choices, you become more happy\" should be \"you make your own choices, which makes you more happy.\" Also, some pronouns aren't clear, like \"he's\" without a clear antecedent.\n","\n","Potential improvements could include simplifying complex sentences, using more precise vocabulary, enhancing transitions, and fixing grammatical errors. The essay has a strong message, and with these tweaks, it would be even more effective.\n","\n","I should structure my feedback to cover each aspect clearly, pointing out specific examples where improvements can be made. It's important to be constructive, so the writer knows exactly where to focus their revisions.\n","</think>\n","\n","**Feedback on the Essay: \"The Best Time in Life is When You Become Yourself\"**\n","\n","**Overall Impression:**\n","The essay effectively conveys the importance of self-authenticity, supported by personal anecdotes and biblical references, which add depth. The structure is clear with three main points, though the conclusion feels slightly repetitive. The writer's passion is evident, but conciseness could enhance clarity.\n","\n","**Cohesion:**\n","The essay flows well, with each paragraph connecting to the central theme. However, smoother transitions and clearer connections, especially in personal examples, would improve readability. For instance, adding transitions like \"For example\" could bridge ideas more effectively.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","The essay uses varied sentence lengths, which is positive. However, some complex sentences may confuse readers. Simplifying and breaking these into shorter sentences could enhance clarity. Avoiding overuse of \"and\" or \"but\" at sentence starts could also lend a more formal tone.\n","\n","**Vocabulary:**\n","The vocabulary is adequate, but precision could be improved. For example, replacing \"amazing\" with \"impressive\" might convey the intended meaning better. Reducing repetition of words like \"happy\" and \"respect\" would enrich the language.\n","\n","**Phraseology:**\n","Most phrases are clear, but some are awkward. Correcting constructions like \"the world that constantly trying\" to \"the world that constantly tries\" would improve clarity. Active voice in place of passive constructions could strengthen the message.\n","\n","**Grammar and Conventions:**\n","The essay has run-on sentences, missing commas, and subject-verb agreement issues. For example, correcting \"you make your own choices, you become more happy\" to \"you make your own choices, which makes you more happy\" would fix the issue. Clarifying pronouns like \"he's\" with clear antecedents would aid understanding.\n","\n","**Potential Improvements:**\n","- Simplify complex sentences.\n","- Use more precise vocabulary.\n","- Enhance transitions for smoother flow.\n","- Correct grammatical errors for clarity and impact.\n","\n","This feedback aims to guide the writer in refining their essay, enhancing its effectiveness and readability while maintaining the strong, positive message. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<think>\n","Okay, I need to provide feedback on this essay based on the user's request. The aspects to cover are Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions. Let me start by reading the essay carefully.\n","\n","The essay talks about how problems can change a person and help them understand things differently. The author shares personal experiences, like moving to the U.S. and dealing with shyness, and how their mother's fear of heights made them realize different perspectives.\n","\n","First, looking at Overall. The essay has a main idea about problems causing change and understanding. The personal anecdotes support this, but the structure is a bit disorganized. Some sentences are repetitive, and the conclusion is abrupt. So, overall, the message is good but needs better structure and flow.\n","\n","Next, Cohesion. The essay has some logical jumps. For example, the transition from shyness to understanding how things work isn't smooth. There are run-on sentences and missing transitions, which makes it hard to follow. Adding transition words and clarifying the flow would help.\n","\n","Moving on to Syntax. The sentences are mostly simple and clear, but some are too long and run-on. Breaking them into shorter sentences would improve readability. Also, varying the sentence structure could make the writing more engaging.\n","\n","Vocabulary is basic, which is okay, but there's some overuse of words like \"change.\" Expanding the vocabulary with more precise terms could enhance the essay. For example, instead of \"different,\" using words like \"unique\" or \"distinctive\" might add depth.\n","\n","Phraseology refers to the way phrases are used. The author repeats phrases like \"different way\" and \"change.\" Using synonyms or rephrasing could make the essay more interesting. Also, some phrases are unclear, like \"rue the change,\" which might mean \"regret\" but isn't entirely clear.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions have several issues. There are subject-verb agreement errors, like \"things wok\" which should be \"work.\" Pronouns like \"it\" and \"you\" are used without clear antecedents. Comma splices and missing commas in compound sentences are present. Correcting these would improve the professionalism of the essay.\n","\n","In summary, the essay has a strong message but suffers from structural and grammatical issues. The author could benefit from proofreading and revising for clarity and coherence. Adding more precise vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also help. Overall, with some polishing, the essay could be more effective.\n","</think>\n","\n","**Feedback on the Essay**\n","\n","**Overall:**\n","The essay presents a clear central idea about how problems can lead to personal change and understanding. Personal anecdotes effectively support this theme, demonstrating growth and insight. However, the structure is somewhat disorganized, with repetitive points and abrupt conclusions. Improved organization and a more engaging narrative could enhance the essay's impact.\n","\n","**Cohesion:**\n","The essay lacks smooth transitions between ideas, particularly when moving from personal experiences to broader conclusions. Logical connections are sometimes missing, making the flow uneven. Adding transition words and clarifying the sequence of ideas would improve coherence.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","While the sentences are generally simple and clear, some are unnecessarily long and run-on. Breaking these into shorter sentences would enhance readability. Additionally, varying sentence structure could make the writing more engaging and dynamic.\n","\n","**Vocabulary:**\n","The vocabulary is basic but adequate. There is some overuse of certain words, such as \"change,\" which could be replaced with more precise terms to add depth. Expanding the lexicon with varied and specific language would enrich the essay.\n","\n","**Phraseology:**\n","The essay benefits from varied phrasing, but some expressions are repetitive. For instance, \"different way\" and \"change\" are used frequently. Replacing these with synonyms or rephrasing could add interest. Additionally, some phrases are unclear, such as \"rue the change,\" which could be clarified for precision.\n","\n","**Grammar and Conventions:**\n","There are several grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues and unclear pronoun usage. Correcting these would improve the essay's professionalism. Additionally, fixing comma splices and ensuring proper comma placement in compound sentences would enhance clarity.\n","\n","**Conclusion:**\n","The essay has a strong message but needs structural and grammatical refinement. With improved organization, varied vocabulary, and precise phrasing, the essay could become more effective and engaging. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<think>\n","Okay, so I need to provide feedback on this essay based on several aspects: Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions. The user has already given a detailed response, but I need to think through how to approach this as if I'm just starting to analyze the essay.\n","\n","First, looking at the Overall aspect. The essay seems to be about the writer's preference for working alone versus in a group. But it's really hard to follow because of the numerous typos and unclear sentences. The message isn't coming through clearly. I can tell the writer is trying to express their thoughts, but the lack of proper structure and grammar makes it difficult to understand.\n","\n","Moving on to Cohesion. The essay doesn't flow well. The ideas jump around a lot, and there's no clear connection between the sentences. For example, one sentence might talk about working in a group, and the next might abruptly switch to something else without any transition. This makes it hard to follow the main argument.\n","\n","Syntax is another issue. The sentences are often run-on or incomplete. There are many instances where the writer starts a thought but doesn't finish it, or where sentences are too long and confusing. This makes the essay hard to read and understand.\n","\n","Vocabulary is quite limited and sometimes incorrect. There are repeated words that don't fit the context, and some words are misspelled. For example, \"cash\" is used where \"group\" might make more sense, and there are many typos like \"evevbaid\" and \"cnfsg\". This suggests that the writer might not have a strong grasp of the necessary vocabulary for the topic.\n","\n","Phraseology is also problematic. The writer uses phrases that don't make sense or are misused. For instance, \"if work with alone\" should probably be \"if I work alone.\" The lack of prepositions and correct phrasing disrupts the flow of the essay.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions are definitely an issue. There are numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement, incorrect tense usage, and misuse of articles. For example, \"i like to work with a group a cash\" should likely be \"I like to work with a group, especially in cash.\" The lack of proper punctuation also makes the essay harder to follow.\n","\n","To improve, the writer should start by proofreading and correcting all the grammatical errors. They should also work on expanding their vocabulary and using correct phrasing. Improving sentence structure and adding transitions would help with cohesion. Maybe they could outline their main points first to ensure the essay flows logically.\n","\n","I think the key areas to focus on are grammar, sentence structure, and clarity. The writer's message is unclear because of these issues, so fixing them would make the essay much stronger.\n","</think>\n","\n","**Feedback on the Essay:**\n","\n","**Overall Impression:**\n","The essay presents a personal reflection on the preference for working alone versus in a group.

This disrupts the flow and makes it difficult to follow the main argument. Improving sentence connections and logical sequencing would enhance clarity.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","The syntax is inconsistent, featuring run-on sentences and incomplete thoughts. Shortening sentences and ensuring proper structure would improve readability.\n","\n","**Vocabulary:**\n","The vocabulary is limited and sometimes misused. Expanding the word bank and ensuring correct word usage would strengthen the essay.\n","\n","**Phraseology:**\n","Misused phrases and lack of prepositions hinder understanding.

The user has already given a detailed feedback, but I need to think through how I would approach this task if I were just starting out.\n","\n","First, I'll read through the essay to get a sense of what it's about. It seems like the essay is about the author's preference for working alone versus in a group, and how that affects their performance.

However, the text is quite jumbled and hard to follow because of many typos and grammatical errors.\n","\n","Now, breaking down the feedback aspects:\n","\n","1. **Overall**: The essay seems to have a main idea but it's not clearly developed. The structure is confusing because of the errors, making it hard to follow the arguments.\n","\n","2. **Cohesion**: The essay lacks logical flow. Ideas are presented but not connected well. For example, sentences about Sam's preferences are scattered without clear transitions.\n","\n","3. **Syntax**: The sentence structure is often unclear. There are run-on sentences and fragments, which disrupt the readability.\n","\n","4. **Vocabulary**: The word choice is limited and sometimes incorrect. For example, \"salsas\" seems like it should be \"salsa,\" but it's unclear. There are also misspellings like \"cnfsg\" which should be \"confuse.\"\n","\n","5. **Phraseology**: The use of phrases is awkward. Phrases like \"if you work with a group\" are repeated without variation, and some phrases don't make sense, like \"i Ward with a group.\"\n","\n","6. **Grammar and Conventions**: There are numerous grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect tenses, and punctuation mistakes. For example, \"i like to work\" should be \"I like to work.\"\n","\n","Thinking about improvements, I would suggest revising the essay to clarify the main points, using proper grammar and correct vocabulary. Adding transitions and restructuring sentences to improve flow would help. Maybe breaking the essay into clear paragraphs with a thesis statement and supporting points would make it more organized.\n","\n","I also notice that the essay has a lot of repetition, so condensing the ideas and varying the sentence structure could make it more engaging. Ensuring that each paragraph focuses on a single idea and connects to the main thesis would enhance the overall coherence.\n","\n","Another area to improve is the use of examples. The essay mentions Sam, but it doesn't provide enough context about who Sam is or how his experiences relate to the main argument. Adding more specific examples could strengthen the argument.\n","\n","Lastly, proofreading is essential. Fixing typos and grammatical errors would make the essay more professional and easier to read.\n","\n","I think I've covered all the aspects and possible improvements.

They want me to evaluate Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar, and Conventions. Let me start by reading through the essay carefully.\n","\n","First, the essay is about the importance of being oneself, which is a good topic. The structure seems to have three main points: making own choices, happiness, and respecting others. Each point is discussed with examples, which is good. The conclusion wraps it up nicely. So, in terms of overall, the essay has a clear structure and main ideas.\n","\n","Now, looking at Cohesion. The essay flows logically, each paragraph connects to the next. However, some transitions could be smoother. For example, between the first and second paragraphs, it's a bit abrupt. Maybe adding a sentence like \"Furthermore, being yourself leads to happiness\" would help. Also, some sentences are a bit long and could be broken down for better readability.\n","\n","Moving on to Syntax. The sentences vary in length, which is good, but there are some run-on sentences. For example, \"Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\" This could be split into two sentences for clarity. Also, some sentences start with \"Because,\" which is fine, but varying the sentence structure might make it more engaging.\n","\n","Vocabulary is decent, but there's some repetition. Words like \"choices,\" \"happy,\" and \"respect\" are used multiple times. Expanding the vocabulary could enhance the essay. Maybe using synonyms or more precise words where applicable.\n","\n","Phraseology refers to the way phrases are constructed. Some phrases are a bit awkward. For example, \"It's your life and you do what you think is right.\" It might be better as \"It's your life, and you should do what you think is right.\" Also, some passive voice constructions could be active for stronger sentences.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions: There are some errors. For example, \"you become more happy\" should be \"happier\" or \"more happy\" isn't common. Also, \"I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself\" should be \"is when you are yourself.\" There are punctuation issues, like missing commas and incorrect comma placement. For example, \"the world that constantly trying to make you something else\" should be \"the world that is constantly trying to make you something else.\"\n","\n","Overall, the essay is well-written with clear points, but it can be improved with better transitions, varied sentence structure, expanded vocabulary, and some grammatical corrections. The user might be a student looking to improve their academic writing, so providing specific examples for each area would be helpful.\n","\n","I should structure my feedback clearly, addressing each aspect with specific examples. Maybe also suggest improvements, like using a thesaurus for vocabulary or revising run-on sentences. Keeping the tone constructive and encouraging, so the user feels motivated to make the changes.\n","\n","I need to make sure my feedback is thorough but not overwhelming. Breaking it down into sections will help the user easily see where they can improve.

The structure is logical, with three main points (making your own choices, happiness, and respecting others) supported by personal anecdotes and biblical references. The conclusion effectively summarizes the argument. However, the essay could benefit from tighter organization and more nuanced development of ideas.\n","\n","#### **Cohesion**\n","- **Strengths**: The essay flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one. The personal anecdote about coming to the United States adds a compelling human element.\n","- **Areas for Improvement**: Some transitions between paragraphs feel abrupt. For example, the shift from discussing personal choices to happiness could be smoother. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas, such as explicitly linking the discussion of personal choices to the broader theme of self-actualization.\n","\n","#### **Syntax**\n","- **Strengths**: The essay uses a variety of sentence structures, which adds to its engaging tone. The use of short sentences in places emphasizes key points effectively.\n","- **Areas for Improvement**: There are some run-on sentences that could be split for clarity. For example, the sentence \"Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others\" could be revised to two sentences for better readability. Additionally, the essay could benefit from more varied sentence starters to avoid repetition.\n","\n","#### **Vocabulary**\n","- **Strengths**: The vocabulary is generally clear and appropriate for the topic. The use of words like \"accomplishment,\" \"respect,\" and \"happiness\" effectively conveys the essay's message.\n","- **Areas for Improvement**: The vocabulary could be more nuanced. For example, instead of repeatedly using \"happy,\" consider using words like \"fulfilled\" or \"content.\" Additionally, some phrases like \"It's your life and you do what you think is right\" could be more precise.\n","\n","#### **Phraseology**\n","- **Strengths**: The essay uses a conversational tone that makes it accessible to a broad audience.

The essay is about how problems can change a person and help them understand things differently. \n","\n","First, I notice the overall structure is a bit confusing. The main ideas are there, but they aren't clearly organized. The introduction is a bit abrupt, and the conclusion is missing, which makes the essay feel incomplete.\n","\n","Cohesion is another issue. Some sentences run on and on without proper punctuation or transitions. For example, \"A problem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.\" This sentence is too long and lacks clarity. Breaking it into shorter sentences might help.\n","\n","Looking at syntax, there are some run-on sentences and comma splices. The use of commas isn't always correct. For example, \"For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country.\" This is repetitive and could be tightened up.\n","\n","Vocabulary is a bit basic and repetitive. The essay uses words like \"change\" and \"different\" a lot. Expanding the vocabulary with more precise words could make the essay more engaging. For instance, instead of \"different,\" using words like \"unique\" or \"distinct\" might add variety.\n","\n","Phraseology has some issues too. There are awkward phrases like \"ting wok\" which should be \"things work.\" Also, some prepositions are missing or misplaced, like \"different then\" which should be \"different from.\"\n","\n","Grammar and conventions are problematic. There are missing commas, incorrect use of articles, and subject-verb agreement errors. For example, \"A problem is a change you have to let it do the best on you\" should probably be adjusted for correct tense and agreement.\n","\n","I also notice some spelling mistakes, like \"rueing\" instead of \"ruining\" and \"tings\" instead of \"things.\" These need correction to improve clarity.\n","\n","The essay does have some good points, like the examples with the author's experience moving to the U.S. and their mother's fear of heights. These personal anecdotes could be stronger with more detailed descriptions and clearer connections to the main points.\n","\n","Overall, the essay has potential but needs significant improvements in organization, grammar, and clarity. The author should work on breaking down complex sentences, using more precise vocabulary, and ensuring proper punctuation and transitions between ideas.\n","\n","I'll structure my feedback to cover each aspect the user mentioned, pointing out specific issues and suggesting improvements.

The message is unclear, and the ideas are not well-developed or organized. The essay could benefit from significant revision to improve clarity, coherence, and overall readability.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Cohesion:\n","The essay lacks clear cohesion and logical flow. Ideas are presented in a disjointed manner, and there is little to connect the thoughts or provide a clear progression of ideas. For example:\n","- The essay starts with a discussion about working with a group but does not clearly state the main argument or purpose.\n","- The mention of \"Sam\" and his preferences about working alone or in a group appears abruptly and is not well-integrated into the essay.\n","\n","**Suggestion:** Organize the essay into clear sections or paragraphs that focus on specific ideas (e.g., the benefits of group work vs. the benefits of working alone). Use transition words or phrases to connect ideas and improve the flow.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Syntax:\n","The syntax (sentence structure) in the essay is often unclear or incomplete. Many sentences are run-on or fragmented, making it difficult to follow the intended meaning. For example:\n","- \"if work with alone you don't cnfsg\" → This sentence is incomplete and unclear.\n","- \"i like to work with a group a cash if you work with a group evevbaid hop me and i know wait is the salsas,\" → This sentence is long and convoluted, making it hard to understand.\n","\n","**Suggestion:** Break down long sentences into shorter, clearer ones. Use proper punctuation to separate ideas and ensure that each sentence conveys a complete thought.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Vocabulary:\n","The vocabulary in the essay is limited and often unclear. There are spelling errors and awkward phrasings that hinder the reader's understanding. For example:\n","- \"hopen\" instead of \"hope\"\n","- \"salsas\" instead of \"salaries\"\n","- \"Ward\" instead of \"worked\"\n","\n","**Suggestion:** Expand your vocabulary by using more precise words. Avoid repeating the same words unnecessarily, and consider using synonyms to add variety.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Phraseology:\n","The phraseology (choice of words and phrases) in the essay is often unclear or imprecise. Many phrases do not make sense or are used incorrectly. For example:\n","- \"i Ward with a group is, the group work to gdra and the are rave fit died.\" → This sentence is unclear and does not convey a clear idea.\n","\n","**Suggestion:** Rewrite sentences to ensure that they clearly express your intended meaning. Use precise and appropriate language to describe your ideas.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Grammar and Conventions:\n","The essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement, wrong verb forms, and punctuation mistakes. For example:\n","- \"i like to work with a group a cash\" → Missing article (\"a group of cash\").\n","- \"if work with alone you don't cnfsg\" → Missing verb (\"if you work alone, you don't...\").\n","- \"Sam ta char\" → Likely meant \"Sam the character\" or \"Sam as a character.\"\n","\n","**Suggestion:** Proofread the essay carefully to correct grammatical errors. Consider using a grammar-checking tool or asking someone to review your work for errors.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Improvements:\n","1. **Clarity:** Rewrite sentences to ensure that they clearly express your ideas. For example:\n","   - Instead of \"i like to work with a group a cash,\" write \"I like to work with a group for cash.\"\n","   \n","2. **Organization:** Structure the essay into clear paragraphs with a main idea for each paragraph. For example:\n","   - One paragraph about the benefits of working in a group.\n","   - Another paragraph about the benefits of working alone.\n","   - A third paragraph comparing the two approaches.\n","\n","3. **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread the essay to correct spelling and grammatical errors.

I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident in my English skills, but I'll try my best.\n","\n","First, looking at the Overall aspect. The essay seems to be about working in groups versus working alone. The author is talking about their experience with group work and how it compares to working alone. But honestly, the essay is really hard to follow because there are so many typos and it's kind of all over the place. I can't really tell if there's a clear main point or if the examples make sense.\n","\n","Moving on to Cohesion. Cohesion is about how well the ideas connect. In this essay, the ideas jump around a lot. One sentence is about working with a group, then it switches to working alone, and then back to group work again. There's no clear flow, so it's hard to follow the argument. I think the author could use some transition words or structure the essay in a more logical order, maybe starting with group work pros and then cons, or vice versa.\n","\n","Next is Syntax. Syntax refers to sentence structure. I notice that the sentences are often run-on or have missing punctuation. For example, long sentences without proper breaks make it hard to read. Also, some sentences start strong but don't finish clearly. Maybe using shorter sentences or adding some punctuation would help.\n","\n","Vocabulary is another area. The author uses some interesting words, but there are also a lot of misspellings. Words like \"salsas\" instead of \"skills\" or \"group tam\" which I'm not sure what that means. It seems like the author might have intended to use different words but made mistakes. Expanding the vocabulary and using a thesaurus could help, but they also need to proofread to catch those errors.\n","\n","Phraseology is about how phrases are used. The essay has a lot of phrases like \"if work with alone\" which should be \"if I work alone.\" It feels like the author is struggling with subject-verb agreement and prepositions. Maybe practicing grammar rules or using a grammar guide would help clarify these issues.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions are definitely a big problem here. There are so many run-on sentences, missing articles, and incorrect tense usage. For example, \"i like to work with a group a cash\" should probably be \"I like to work with a group because cash.\" The lack of proper grammar makes it hard to understand the points the author is trying to make. They need to go through each sentence and fix these grammatical errors.\n","\n","In terms of possible improvements, the author should probably start by proofreading the essay multiple times. Maybe even read it out loud to catch mistakes. They could also use online tools like Grammarly to help spot errors. Structuring the essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion would improve cohesion. Breaking down each paragraph into a single idea would help too. Using transition words like \"however,\" \"therefore,\" or \"for example\" would make the essay flow better.\n","\n","Vocabulary-wise, using a thesaurus to find synonyms could make the essay more engaging. They should also make sure each word is spelled correctly. Maybe keeping a list of commonly confused words would help prevent some mistakes.\n","\n","For syntax, working on writing clear, concise sentences would be beneficial. Maybe starting with a topic sentence and then expanding with details. Also, using commas appropriately to separate ideas within a sentence.\n","\n","Overall, the essay has potential but needs significant improvements in grammar, spelling, and structure. The author's ideas are a bit scattered, so organizing them better would make the essay stronger. With more practice and careful editing, this could become a much clearer and more persuasive piece.\n","</think>\n","\n","**Feedback on the Essay**\n","\n","**Overall Impression:**\n","The essay discusses the experience of working in groups versus alone, but it is challenging to follow due to numerous typos and lack of structure.

Let me go through each part as the user suggested: Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions. Hmm, I remember the user provided an example response, but I need to think through it myself.\n","\n","Starting with Overall. The essay is about being oneself and how that's the greatest accomplishment. It has three main points: making your own choices, happiness, and respecting others. It's pretty clear, but maybe it's a bit repetitive. I think the writer has a good message, but it's a bit hard to follow in places because the structure could be tighter.\n","\n","Cohesion. The essay has three sections, each starting with \"First,\" \"Second,\" \"Lastly.\" That helps, but sometimes the ideas jump a bit. For example, when talking about respecting others, it goes into the Bible and then to practical steps. It's a bit choppy. Maybe using more transition words would help connect the ideas better.\n","\n","Syntax. The sentences are mostly simple, which is good for clarity. But some run-on sentences make it harder to read. For instance, \"Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\" That's a bit long and could be split into two sentences.\n","\n","Vocabulary. The writer uses some good words, but it's mostly basic. Maybe using more varied vocabulary could make the essay stronger. For example, instead of \"happy,\" using \"fulfilled\" or \"content.\"\n","\n","Phraseology. Some phrases are a bit awkward. Like \"constantly trying to make you something else\" could be \"constantly trying to change you.\" Also, \"It's your life and you do what you think is right\" is a bit redundant. Maybe rephrase that for smoother flow.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions. There are some mistakes. For example, \"It's your life and you do what you think is right.\" Should be \"you do what you think is right.\" Also, some missing commas, like after introductory phrases. The example had \"Personally when I came to the United States\" which should be \"Personally, when I came...\" There are also some subject-verb agreement issues, like \"respect others will gain them to respect you.\" That should be \"respecting others will gain them respect.\"\n","\n","I think the essay has a good message but needs work in structure, grammar, and some vocabulary. The user also mentioned possible improvements, so I should note those areas where the essay can be enhanced.\n","</think>\n","\n","**Feedback on the Essay**\n","\n","**Overall Impression:**\n","The essay presents a clear and meaningful message about the importance of self-being, structured around three main points: making choices, happiness, and respecting others. While the message is strong, the essay could benefit from tighter organization to enhance readability and impact.\n","\n","**Cohesion:**\n","The essay uses clear section markers (First, Second, Lastly), which aids in following the argument. However, some transitions between ideas are abrupt.建议增加更多连接词，如 \"furthermore\" or \"additionally,\" to create a smoother flow, especially when discussing respecting others and the Bible.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","The use of simple sentences is effective for clarity, but some run-on sentences, like \"Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others,\" could be split for better readability.\n","\n","**Vocabulary:**\n","The vocabulary is mostly basic, which is appropriate for clarity but could be enriched with more varied words. For example, using \"fulfilled\" instead of \"happy\" could add depth.\n","\n","**Phraseology:**\n","Some phrases are awkward. For instance, \"constantly trying to make you something else\" could be refined to \"constantly trying to change you.\" Additionally, \"It's your life and you do what you think is right\" could be rephrased for smoother flow.\n","\n","**Grammar and Conventions:**\n","There are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"respect others will gain them to respect you,\" which should be corrected to \"respecting others will gain them respect.\" Also, punctuation issues, like missing commas after introductory phrases, need attention.\n","\n","**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n","- Tighten the structure to improve flow.\n","- Use more varied vocabulary to enhance expression.\n","- Revise awkward phrases for smoother language.\n","- Address grammatical errors and punctuation issues for polished writing.\n","\n","Overall, the essay has a strong message that could be elevated with attention to structural, grammatical, and stylistic refinements. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<think>\n","Okay, I need to provide feedback on this essay based on the aspects: Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions. Let me go through each part step by step.\n","\n","First, I'll read the essay carefully to understand the main ideas. The essay talks about how problems are changes that can make a person see things differently and understand how things work. The author uses personal examples, like moving to the US and their mother's fear of heights, to illustrate these points.\n","\n","Starting with Overall: The essay has a good message about personal growth through problems, but it's a bit repetitive and lacks a clear structure. The examples are relevant but could use more development to fully convey the points.\n","\n","Cohesion: The essay is a bit disjointed. The ideas are there, but transitions between paragraphs are weak. For example, the second paragraph starts with \"First of all\" but doesn't clearly connect to the previous idea. Using more transition words would help the flow.\n","\n","Syntax: The sentences are often long and run-on, making it hard to follow. Breaking some sentences into shorter ones would improve readability. Also, some sentences are redundant, like repeating \"because i think that\" which can be streamlined.\n","\n","Vocabulary: The vocabulary is basic and could be enriched. Words like \"different\" are used a lot; more precise terms could add depth. For instance, instead of \"different,\" using words like \"unique\" or \"distinct\" might be better.\n","\n","Phraseology: There are some awkward phrases and word choice issues. For example, \"A problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand.\" It would be clearer to say, \"Problems can change you by helping you understand.\" Also, some phrases are repetitive, like \"see different ways,\" which could be varied.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions: There are several grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues, missing commas, and incorrect tense usage. For example, \"A problem is a change you have to let it do the best on you\" should be restructured. Also, some sentences lack proper punctuation, making them harder to read.\n","\n","Possible improvements include enhancing transitions, revising run-on sentences, expanding vocabulary, clarifying phrases, and correcting grammatical errors. Adding a conclusion would wrap up the essay nicely.\n","\n","Overall, the essay has potential but needs work in structure, grammar, and style to become more effective.\n","</think>\n","\n","**Feedback on the Essay:**\n","\n","**Overall:**\n","The essay presents a thoughtful exploration of personal growth through challenges, with relevant examples. However, it could benefit from a clearer structure and more developed ideas to enhance its impact.\n","\n","**Cohesion:**\n","Improve transitions between paragraphs to ensure a smoother flow. Using transition words like \"furthermore\" or \"for instance\" can help connect ideas more effectively.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","Break down long, run-on sentences for better readability. Streamlining redundant phrases will also improve the clarity and pacing of the essay.\n","\n","**Vocabulary:**\n","Expand the vocabulary with more precise terms. For example, using \"unique\" instead of \"different\" can add depth to the discussion.\n","\n","**Phraseology:**\n","Clarify and rephrase awkward phrases. For instance, refining sentences to be more direct, such as changing \"A problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand\" to \"Problems can change you by helping you understand.\"\n","\n","**Grammar and Conventions:**\n","Correct grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and missing punctuation. Ensure consistent tense usage and proper sentence structure throughout the essay.\n","\n","**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n","- **Enhance Transitions:** Use transition words to link ideas smoothly.\n","- **Revise Sentences:** Break down complex sentences and eliminate redundancies.\n","- **Expand Vocabulary:** Incorporate a wider range of words to enrich the essay.\n","- **Clarify Phrasing:** Refine phrases for clarity and precision.\n","- **Correct Grammar:** Address grammatical issues for improved readability.\n","- **Add Conclusion:** Conclude the essay to summarize and reinforce the main points.\n","\n","In summary, with attention to structure, grammar, and style, the essay has the potential to be a compelling exploration of personal growth through adversity. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","<think>\n","Okay, I just received a query where the user wants feedback on an essay they provided. The feedback needs to cover several aspects: Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions, explicitly noting possible improvements. \n","\n","Looking at the essay, I notice it's quite jumbled and hard to follow. There are a lot of run-on sentences and misspellings. The user's main points seem to be about working in groups versus alone, but the essay is all over the place. \n","\n","First, I should assess the Overall aspect. The essay isn't clear or well-structured. It lacks a clear thesis and logical flow. I need to point out that the ideas are repetitive and disorganized.\n","\n","Next, Cohesion. The essay lacks clear connectors, so the ideas don't flow smoothly. I'll suggest adding transition words to improve this.\n","\n","For Syntax, the sentences are mostly run-ons. They need to be broken into shorter, clearer ones. I'll recommend using periods and maybe some commas to fix the structure.\n","\n","Vocabulary-wise, there are misspellings and unclear words. I'll need to correct those and suggest better word choices where applicable.\n","\n","Phraseology is off. There are awkward phrases that make the essay hard to understand. I should suggest rephrasing sentences for clarity.\n","\n","Grammar and Conventions are definitely issues. Missing spaces, incorrect tenses, and punctuation errors are everywhere. I'll need to point these out and offer corrections.\n","\n","I also notice that the essay doesn't have a clear argument or counterclaims. It just rambles about working alone or in groups without a central idea. I'll suggest developing a thesis and supporting it with examples.\n","\n","Overall, the essay needs extensive editing. The user probably wants to improve their writing skills, maybe for academic purposes. They might not realize how unclear their essay is, so constructive feedback is key. I'll structure my response to cover each aspect clearly, providing specific examples and corrections where possible. I should make sure to be encouraging and supportive, letting them know they can improve with some work.\n","</think>\n","\n","The essay provided is difficult to understand due to numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and unclear phrasing. Below is feedback on the requested aspects, along with suggestions for improvement:\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Overall**\n","The essay lacks clarity, coherence, and a clear central idea. It appears to explore the writer's thoughts on working individually versus in groups, but the ideas are repetitive and disorganized. The essay would benefit from a clear structure, a well-defined thesis, and logical flow.\n","\n","**Improvement:**  \n","- Develop a clear thesis statement that reflects the main argument.  \n","- Organize the essay into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a single idea.  \n","- Avoid repetitive ideas and ensure each sentence contributes to the overall argument.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Cohesion**\n","The essay lacks cohesion, as ideas are loosely connected and often jump from one thought to another without clear transitions. The flow of ideas is disrupted by grammatical errors and unclear phrasing.\n","\n","**Improvement:**  \n","- Use transition words (e.g., \"however,\" \"therefore,\" \"in contrast\") to connect ideas.  \n","- Ensure each paragraph builds on the previous one logically.  \n","- Avoid abrupt shifts in ideas.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Syntax**\n","The essay contains numerous syntax errors, such as run-on sentences, missing punctuation, and unclear sentence structures.

Many words are misspelled or used incorrectly, which makes the essay challenging to understand. Additionally, some words appear to be randomly inserted or repeated without purpose.\n","\n","**Improvement:**  \n","- Use a broader range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.  \n","- Avoid repeating the same words unnecessarily.  \n","- Ensure all words are spelled correctly (e.g., \"salsa\" is misspelled as \"salsas,\" \"group\" as \"gdra\").\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Phraseology**\n","The phraseology in the essay is awkward and unclear. Many phrases lack meaning due to spelling errors or grammatical mistakes. For example, \"if work with alone you don't cnfsg\" is unclear and does not contribute to the essay's meaning.\n","\n","**Improvement:**  \n","- Rephrase sentences to ensure clarity and coherence.  \n","- Avoid using vague or nonsensical phrases.  \n","- Use precise language to convey ideas effectively.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Grammar and Conventions**\n","The essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including:\n","- Missing spaces between words (e.g., \"togroup\" instead of \"to group\").  \n","- Incorrect verb forms (e.g., \"Ward with a group is\" should be \"Working with a group is\").  \n","- Misuse of tense (e.g., \"he know\" instead of \"he knows\").  \n","- Missing punctuation (e.g., periods, commas).  \n","- Misplaced modifiers.  \n","\n","**Improvement:**  \n","- Proofread the essay carefully to correct spelling and grammatical errors.  \n","- Use correct tense and subject-verb agreement.  \n","- Ensure proper punctuation is used throughout.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Specific Suggestions for Improvement**\n","1. **Clarity and Organization:**  \n","   - Start with a clear introduction that presents the main argument.  \n","   - Use topic sentences to introduce each paragraph's main idea.  \n","   - Conclude with a strong summary that reinforces the thesis.\n","\n","2. **Grammar and Mechanics:**  \n","   - Correct all spelling mistakes (e.g., \"salsas,\" \"cnfsg,\" \"gdra\").  \n","   - Use correct verb forms (e.g., \"is\" instead of \"are\" in \"i know wait\").  \n","   - Add appropriate punctuation to separate ideas (e.g., periods, commas).\n","\n","3. **Style and Tone:**  \n","   - Use a formal tone suitable for academic writing.  \n","   - Avoid contractions (e.g., \"i\" instead of \"I\").  \n","   - Vary sentence structure to enhance readability.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Final Note**\n","The essay has the potential to explore a meaningful topic (e.g., the pros and cons of working in groups versus alone), but it needs significant revision to improve clarity, grammar, and structure.
