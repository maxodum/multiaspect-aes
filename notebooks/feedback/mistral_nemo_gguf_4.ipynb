Please provide feedback on the following aspects: Overall, Cohesion, Syntax, Vocabulary, Phraseology, Grammar and Conventions, explicitly noting possible improvements where applicable.\n","\n","The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\n","\n","First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you're doing. Because you're defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life and you do what you think is right.\n","\n","Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says \"Those who know God should love others, because God is love.\"\n","\n","Not being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends.\n","\n","Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says \" Honor your father and mother.\"\n","\n","If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing.\n","\n","Some may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays it's really hard to become yourself.\n","\n","In conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. \"\"\"\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KjXMZot5EyZM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746031940384,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":71,"user":{"displayName":"Максим Думенков","userId":"09797172204664177173"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_mid = \"\"\"You are given the following essay.

A\n","\n","problem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.\n","\n","First of all it can make you see different then the others. For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but i remember that i was really shy but i think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that i never see in my life but i just need to see it from a different way and dont let nothing happened and ruing the change that i want to make because of just a problem. For example i think that nothing was going to change me and that i dont need to be shy anymore became i need to start seeing everything in a different ways because you can get mad at every one but you need to know what is going to happened after,\n","\n","people may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and don't let nothing or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and can't do nothing about it because is your choice and your problems and you can decide what to do with it.\n","\n","second of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems but she have faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and i'm not scare of high i did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time i see my mom in a airplane it make me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but i see it from a different way and i like the high but also she have to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can no be the same as you. For example i think that my mom and me are different because we are and i have to understand that she does not like high and i need to understand that. to help someone to understand how things work you need to start to see how things work in that persons life.\n","\n","A problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand.

However, it could benefit from better organization, clarity, and conciseness.\n","\n","**Cohesion:** The essay lacks a clear introduction that states the thesis and provides a roadmap for the arguments that follow. The transitions between ideas are sometimes weak or missing, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. To improve cohesion, consider using signposting language (e.g., \"Firstly,\" \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" \"On the other hand,\" \"Finally\") and ensuring that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and supports the thesis.\n","\n","**Syntax:** The sentences are generally simple and easy to understand, but there are instances of run-on sentences and sentence fragments that could be combined or corrected to improve flow and clarity. For example:\n","\n","* Original: \"Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\"\n","* Revised: \"Making your own choices not only brings happiness but also fosters respect for others.\"\n","\n","**Vocabulary:** The author uses a good range of vocabulary, but there is some repetition (e.g., \"be yourself\" appears multiple times). To improve vocabulary, consider using synonyms and related words (e.g., \"authentic,\" \"genuine,\" \"true to oneself,\" \"express oneself,\" \"embrace one's identity\").\n","\n","**Phraseology:** Some phrases are awkward or unclear. For instance:\n","\n","* Original: \"I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else.\"\n","* Revised: \"I agree that the greatest accomplishment is to be oneself in a world that constantly tries to make us something else.\"\n","\n","**Grammar and Conventions:**\n","\n","1. Tense consistency: The author switches between present and past tense. Stick to present tense for general truths and personal experiences in the past tense.\n","2. Sentence structure: Vary sentence structure to make the essay more engaging. Currently, many sentences start with \"You\" or \"Some.\"\n","3. Punctuation: Ensure commas and periods are used correctly to separate clauses and complete thoughts.\n","4. Capitalization: Capitalize proper nouns (e.g., \"Bible\") and avoid starting sentences with lowercase letters.\n","5. Citation: When referring to the Bible, provide the specific verse or passage for better credibility.\n","\n","**Possible Improvements:**\n","\n","1. **Introduction:** Start with a hook or a clear statement of the thesis, e.g., \"In a world that often pressures us to conform, being true to oneself is a challenge and a triumph.\"\n","2. **Organization:** Break down the essay into clear, manageable sections with distinct topics, e.g., \"The Importance of Being Oneself,\" \"Overcoming Fear and Peer Pressure,\" \"The Connection Between Happiness and Authenticity,\" and \"The Power of Respect.\"\n","3. **Clarity:** Be specific about the points you're making. For example, instead of saying \"Some people are afraid to make their own choice,\" consider providing specific examples or statistics.\n","4. **Counterargument:** Address opposing viewpoints more effectively. Instead of dismissing them with \"Some may disagree,\" acknowledge the opposing argument and explain why you disagree.\n","5. **Conclusion:** Summarize the main points and restate the thesis in a clear, concise manner. Consider ending with a call to action or a thought-provoking question.\n","\n","**Grade:** With the given feedback and suggested improvements, the essay could potentially be improved to a B+ or A- level. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**Feedback:**\n","\n","**Overall:** The essay presents a personal reflection on how problems can be opportunities for growth and understanding. However, it's quite disjointed and could benefit from better organization, clarity, and cohesion.\n","\n","**Cohesion:** The essay lacks clear cohesion, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.

However, it could benefit from better organization, more varied sentence structures, and improved vocabulary and phrasing. The essay also contains some grammatical errors and unconventional expressions.\n","\n","**Cohesion:** The essay lacks clear cohesion, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought at times. There are sudden shifts in topic and perspective, and some ideas are not fully developed or connected to the main argument. To improve cohesion, the author could use more transitional phrases and ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and supports the main argument.\n","\n","**Syntax:** The syntax is simple but repetitive, with many sentences starting with \"I\" or \"Like\". Varying sentence structures would make the essay more engaging. For example, instead of starting every sentence with \"I\", the author could use passive voice or omit the subject to create more varied sentences.\n","\n","**Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is limited, and some words are used repeatedly (e.g., \"participate\", \"students\", \"teacher\").

Not only does it demonstrate to teachers what students have learned, but it also helps students review and reinforce their understanding of the material. Moreover, participating in class activities allows students to show teachers that they are engaged and paying attention, which can lead to better grades and faster learning. For instance, if a teacher puts a game on the smart board that requires participation to play \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**Feedback:**\n","\n","**Overall:** The essay seems to be a mix of quotes and original thoughts, with some sentences being quite challenging to understand due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. It appears to be discussing the purpose of activity versus inactivity, using the poem \"The New Colossus\" by Emma Lazarus as a reference point.\n","\n","**Cohesion:** The essay lacks clear cohesion. Ideas are not well-connected, and the flow of thought is disrupted by abrupt changes in topic and sentence structure. To improve cohesion, the writer should use transition words and phrases to connect ideas and create a smoother flow. For example, instead of jumping from \"he is a good\" to \"now they are more procession,\" the writer could use a transition like \"However, as time passed, they became more procession.\"\n","\n","**Syntax:** The sentence structure is often complex and confusing, making it difficult to follow the intended meaning. Simplifying sentences and using a variety of sentence structures can make the essay easier to read and understand. For instance, \"because and the more many education for student and school\" could be simplified to \"As more students and schools receive education, they become more...\"\n","\n","**Vocabulary:** The writer uses some advanced vocabulary, but there are also instances of incorrect or inappropriate word choice. For example, \"prescient\" is used incorrectly, and \"procession\" is used in an unusual context. Using a thesaurus or a language learning tool can help the writer choose the right words.\n","\n","**Phraseology:** Some phrases are awkward or unclear. For instance, \"the are a one solution for you\" is difficult to understand. Breaking down complex ideas into simpler phrases can help clarify the meaning. Additionally, using more idiomatic expressions can make the writing sound more natural. For example, instead of \"the more school for one,\" the writer could say \"the more schools there are, the more opportunities there are for one to learn.\"\n","\n","**Grammar and Conventions:** There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay, including subject-verb disagreement, incorrect verb tense, and missing articles. Here are a few specific examples:\n","\n","- \"he is a good\" should be \"he is good\" or \"he is a good person\"\n","- \"now the are more procession\" should be \"now they are more procession\" or \"now there are more procession\"\n","- \"because the good more the one is information for access\" should be \"because the more information one has access to, the better\"\n","- \"because is not like the brazen giant of Greek fame with conquering one nation for is the imprison the eyes command the one book for people\" is very confusing and should be rephrased for clarity.\n","\n","**Improvements:**\n","\n","1. Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas and improve cohesion.\n","2. Simplify sentence structure and vary sentence length to improve readability.\n","3. Check word choice to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.\n","4. Break down complex ideas into simpler phrases to improve clarity.\n","5. Use more idiomatic expressions to make the writing sound more natural.\n","6. Proofread for grammatical errors, ensuring subject-verb agreement, correct verb tense, and proper article usage.\n","\n","**Response to the prompt:**\n","\n","The writer does not directly address the prompt about taking a position on whether accomplishing more is achieved through constant activity or if inactivity also serves a purpose. To respond to this, the writer could argue that both activity and inactivity have their roles in achieving success. For example, constant activity can lead to progress and achievement, but inactivity, such as taking a break or reflecting, can also be beneficial for recharging and gaining new perspectives. The writer could use specific examples to illustrate this point, such as the importance of rest for athletes or the benefits of meditation for mental clarity. The response should be structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, using proper grammar and cohesive language. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**Feedback:**\n","\n","**Overall:** The essay is a personal narrative about the author's experiences with cars and soccer, and their relationship with a girl they met through the sport. However, it's quite challenging to follow due to numerous spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and unconventional phrasing. With some improvements in these areas, the essay could be engaging and coherent.\n","\n","**Cohesion:** The essay lacks clear cohesion and progression of ideas. Some sentences are disconnected, and there's no clear introduction or conclusion. Using transition words and ensuring each paragraph flows logically into the next would improve cohesion.\n","\n","**Syntax:** Sentences are often fragmented, run-on, or have incorrect structure. Breaking down long sentences, using proper punctuation, and ensuring each sentence has a clear subject and verb would improve syntax.\n","\n","**Vocabulary:** The author uses simple vocabulary, but there are many misspellings and incorrect word choices. For example, \"bay\" should be \"buy\", \"buskel\" should be \"bicycle\", and \"begeth\" should be \"beast\". Using a dictionary and thesaurus can help expand vocabulary and ensure correct spelling.\n","\n","**Phraseology:** Some phrases are unconventional or incorrect, such as \"I stirt taking caer to it\" (I started caring about it), \"i usto have a buskel\" (I used to have a bicycle), and \"i stirt looking for a beges thengs\" (I started looking for a beast). Using standard English phrasing would make the essay easier to understand.\n","\n","**Grammar and Conventions:** There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay. Here are a few examples:\n","\n","- \"I bay a car and it new\" should be \"I bought a car and it was new.\"\n","- \"i usto love that baskel so mauh\" should be \"I used to love that bicycle so much.\"\n","- \"i stirt looking for a beges thengs\" should be \"I started looking for a beast of a thing.\"\n","- \"my lieg get hert\" should be \"my leg got hurt.\"\n","- \"i stirt fling better\" should be \"I started feeling better.\"\n","- \"i wanted her number so i stirt beang cloes to her\" should be \"I wanted her number so I started being close to her.\"\n","- \"it bean a year so i finly say it\" should be \"it took a year so I finally said it.\"\n","\n","**Possible Improvements:**\n","\n","1. **Cohesion:** Use transition words to connect ideas. For example, \"Moreover\", \"In addition\", \"As a result\", \"Meanwhile\", \"On the other hand\", etc.\n","2. **Syntax:** Break down long sentences, ensure each sentence has a clear subject and verb, and use proper punctuation.\n","3. **Vocabulary:** Use a dictionary and thesaurus to ensure correct spelling and expand vocabulary.\n","4. **Phraseology:** Use standard English phrasing and avoid unconventional or incorrect phrases.\n","5. **Grammar and Conventions:** Proofread the essay for grammatical errors, ensuring each sentence is grammatically correct.\n","\n","**Revised Example:**\n","\n","\"My name is Generic_Name, and my story is about my experiences with cars and soccer. I bought a car when it was new, and I loved that car so much that I started taking care of it. Before that, I used to have a bicycle, and I loved it so much, but as I grew older, I stopped riding it. I started looking for something more challenging, and that's when I was introduced to soccer.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**Feedback:**\n","\n","**Overall:** The essay presents a clear argument against allowing students to have phones during tests. However, it needs significant improvement in terms of language use, structure, and coherence.\n","\n","**Cohesion:** The essay lacks cohesive devices to connect ideas and improve flow. Using transition words and phrases can help improve cohesion. For example, \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" \"Furthermore,\" \"However,\" \"Despite,\" etc.\n","\n","**Syntax:** The sentences are often fragmented, run-on, or poorly structured, making them difficult to understand.
